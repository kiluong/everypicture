                <hr>
                <p>Coffee or tea? I prefer tea. Well, specifically, Matcha green tea. Matcha has become an essential part of my morning routine. Every day, I look forward to sipping on a Matcha Latte as I head to work— it’s the perfect way to wake up and energize myself for the day ahead. I also own a matcha whisking kit, which I absolutely love using. The process of whisking the matcha adds a mindful touch to my morning, helping me feel more grounded and ready to embrace the day.</p>
